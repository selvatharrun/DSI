Deep Learning Basics Repository

This repository serves as a collection of foundational materials from my college deep learning courses. It includes lecture notes, code snippets, assignments, and resources covering the essentials of deep learning, such as neural networks, activation functions, backpropagation, optimization techniques, and introductory model architectures. Designed for beginners and enthusiasts, this repo aims to provide a clear and structured starting point for understanding the core concepts of deep learning. Contributions, suggestions, or questions are welcome as I continue to learn and expand this knowledge base!
